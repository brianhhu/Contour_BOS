# Contour_BOS
Project code associated with Hu_etal '17 paper on contour integration and border ownership assignment

### Introduction

The program is written in MATLAB (Mathworks). The code is known to run on R2014a, but should also be compatible with other versions. The main program function is **demo.m**. Running this program will run the network model for different inputs. To reproduce the figures used in the paper, run **plot_figs.m**. For more details about the model, please see:
